        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a Front-End Developer based in Vancouver. I start my web developing journey since 2016. I always have a passion to build a fast, reliable and user-intuitive web application.</p>
        <p><i>"I'm still learning." </i>is my favourite quotes from Michelangelo.</p>
        <p>So, in the begininig of 2020, my first learning task is to learn more about Gatsby. And I would like to share my ups and downs through my blog posts.</p>
        <p>I hope it could help you tackle some learning curve.</p>
